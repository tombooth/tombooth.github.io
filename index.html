                    I bring together a strong technical background with a track record
                    of great delivery, product strategy and stakeholder management. I
                    believe that technology doesn‚Äôt exist in a vacuum. Engaging
                    the people involved is critical. Users, team members, the
                    C-level managers. We're people solving problems for other
                    people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Straight from my first role I was trying to marry cutting edge technology (NLP) with a great customer experience. I‚Äôve shifted focus onto how platforms can support a growing business from both a strategic and operational perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‚ÄúBuild something people want to use‚Äù summarises how I think about the platforms at RVU. Ensuring that there is clear value for the users and the experience interacting with them beats what we could buy externally.

                <p>
                    Leading product, engineering and data for our three platform teams (Customer, Affiliate Marketing and Infrastructure) and support function (Reliability and Security). I lead and manage teams totalling ~25 staff, who deliver our multi-brand strategy allowing us to scale sub-linearly and make the most out of our customers. Some of these teams I‚Äôve grown from scratch (Infrastructure, Reliability and Security) and others I took over as underforming and brought them up to scratch (Customer and Affiliate Marketing).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I conducted the technical and security due diligence for our biggest M+A acquisitions (Penguin Portals ¬£508M and Mojo Mortgages). I now lead various value focused work streams integrating our platforms into these businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have delivered software - in Clojure, Golang, Ruby, Python and JavaScript - and infrastructure - via Terraform/Terrafying on AWS and GCP. But, I now predominantly spend my time on strategy, architecture, programme management and mentoring.

                <p>
                    I led the developers in the Performance Platform team and then the GOV.UK teams. I was delivering software across the stack primarily in: JavaScript, Python, Ruby and Puppet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role consisted of significant departmental engagement both through the teams I was on and also as a GDS Service assessor. This also included working with the European Council's Semantic Interoperability Community.

                    I conceived of, pitched and delivered a new product that closed the gap between our customers and placing a trade. It used NLP to identify tradable markets in web pages that the customers were browsing, providing them a frictionless trading experience.

                <p>
                    To speed up a Flash migration project I built an ActionScript -> JavaScript transpiler to shift substantial legacy business logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My delivery was done using Java and JavaScript.
